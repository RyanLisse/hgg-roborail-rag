# RoboRail Safety Protocols

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SAFETY NOTICE

**The RoboRail machine is industrial equipment that requires proper training and safety protocols. Always prioritize safety over productivity. When in doubt, STOP and consult with HGG technical support.**

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### Immediate Actions for Emergencies
1. **EMERGENCY STOP**: Press the red emergency stop button immediately
2. **POWER DOWN**: Disconnect main power if safe to do so
3. **SECURE AREA**: Clear personnel from the immediate work area
4. **ASSESS SITUATION**: Check for injuries or immediate hazards
5. **CONTACT SUPPORT**: Call HGG emergency hotline
6. **DOCUMENT**: Record incident details for analysis

### Emergency Stop Locations
- **Primary E-Stop**: Main control panel (red mushroom button)
- **Secondary E-Stop**: Operator pendant (if equipped)
- **External E-Stop**: Safety circuit integration points
- **Remote E-Stop**: Wireless emergency stop (if configured)

## üîí Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) Procedures

### Before ANY Maintenance Work
1. **INFORM** all personnel of maintenance activity
2. **SHUTDOWN** machine using normal stop procedures
3. **ISOLATE** all energy sources (electrical, pneumatic, hydraulic)
4. **LOCKOUT** energy isolation points with personal locks
5. **TAGOUT** with dated, signed tags indicating maintenance
6. **VERIFY** zero energy state before beginning work

### Energy Sources to Isolate
- **Electrical**: Main power disconnect, control power
- **Pneumatic**: Air supply valve, stored pressure release
- **Hydraulic**: Pump isolation, pressure relief (if applicable)
- **Mechanical**: Stored energy in springs, counterweights
- **Thermal**: Hot surfaces, cooling systems

### LOTO Verification Steps
1. **Visual Check**: Confirm all isolation points are locked
2. **Functional Test**: Attempt to operate machine (should not function)
3. **Measurement**: Use meters to verify zero electrical energy
4. **Pressure Check**: Verify pneumatic/hydraulic systems depressurized
5. **Documentation**: Complete LOTO checklist and log
