# Test Validation Report

Generated: 2025-07-20

## Executive Summary

The test suite has significant failures that need to be addressed:

- **Unit Tests**: 61 failures out of 336 tests (18% failure rate)
- **E2E Tests**: All tests failing due to missing mock setup
- **TypeScript Compilation**: Fixed - now passing ✅

## Status Overview

### ✅ Completed

1. Fixed TypeScript compilation errors:
   - Added missing `PerformanceMonitor` class export
   - Fixed `VectorStoreErrorHandler` imports
   - All TypeScript errors resolved

### ❌ Unit Test Failures (61 failures)

#### Major Issues by Category

1. **Vector Store Tests (20+ failures)**

   - Zod validation errors in OpenAI vector store tests
   - Mock objects missing required fields
   - File upload test schemas not matching implementation

2. **Prompt Optimization Tests (6 failures)**

   - Query classification mismatch (procedural vs configuration)
   - Conversation context not being incorporated
   - Document summarization test expecting different behavior
   - Integration test query type mismatch

3. **Feedback Service Tests (2 failures)**

   - Database mock not properly handling `returning()` method
   - Update feedback mock configuration issue

4. **Agent Integration Tests (10+ failures)**
   - Comparison query routing failures
   - Confidence scoring accuracy issues
   - Complex reasoning pattern failures

### ❌ E2E Test Failures (All failing)

The E2E tests are expecting mock responses from `tests/prompts/utils.ts` but the mock system is not properly connected. Key issues:

1. Tests expect specific responses like "It's just green duh!"
2. Mock models are defined but not injected into the application
3. PLAYWRIGHT environment variable is set but mock injection is missing

## Root Causes

### 1. Mock Configuration

The test setup uses `MockLanguageModelV1` but these mocks are not being injected when `PLAYWRIGHT === 'true'`. The application is trying to use real AI models instead of mocks.

### 2. Zod Schema Mismatches

Many vector store tests fail because mock objects don't match the expected Zod schemas. Required fields are missing from test fixtures.

### 3. Test Expectations

Some tests have outdated expectations that don't match current implementation behavior.

## Fix Strategy

### Phase 1: E2E Test Infrastructure

1. Implement proper mock injection in the API routes when PLAYWRIGHT=true
2. Connect test models to the application
3. Ensure mock responses are returned

### Phase 2: Unit Test Fixes

1. Update all Zod schema mocks to include required fields
2. Fix query classification logic in prompt optimization
3. Update feedback service mocks
4. Align agent test expectations with implementation

### Phase 3: Integration

1. Run full test suite after each fix batch
2. Ensure no regressions
3. Update test documentation

## Metrics

- Total Test Files: 32
- Total Tests: 336+ unit tests, 75+ E2E tests
- Current Pass Rate: ~82% unit tests, 0% E2E tests
- Target: 100% pass rate

## Next Steps

1. Fix E2E test mock injection (Priority 1)
2. Fix Zod validation errors in vector store tests (Priority 2)
3. Update remaining unit test expectations (Priority 3)
4. Document test patterns for future maintenance
