# Unused Imports Analysis

## Overview

Analysis of unused import statements across the RRA codebase identified during autonomous code cleanup scan.

## Findings

### 1. Components with Potentially Unused Imports

#### `components/database-selector.tsx`

- **Issue**: File exists but may have unused imports
- **Analysis**: Component is imported in `components/rag-chat.tsx` but the RAG page redirects to main chat
- **Recommendation**: Verify if the RAG chat functionality is still actively used

#### `components/vector-store-monitoring.tsx`

- **Issue**: Complex monitoring component with extensive imports
- **Status**: Used in `app/(chat)/monitoring/page.tsx`
- **Recommendation**: Keep - actively used in monitoring page

#### `components/rag-chat.tsx`

- **Issue**: Large component with many imports, but RAG page redirects
- **Status**: May be orphaned as `/rag` redirects to `/`
- **Recommendation**: Verify if component is used elsewhere, consider removal if not

### 2. Pages with Redirect-Only Logic

#### `app/(chat)/rag/page.tsx`

```typescript
export default function RAGPage() {
  // Redirect to main chat since RAG is now integrated
  redirect("/");
}
```

- **Issue**: Page only contains redirect, no actual functionality
- **Impact**: Creates unnecessary route that immediately redirects
- **Recommendation**: Remove file and update routing if RAG is fully integrated

### 3. Monitoring Page Dependencies

#### `app/(chat)/monitoring/page.tsx`

- **Status**: Active page using VectorStoreMonitoring component
- **Dependencies**: Correctly imports and uses vector-store-monitoring component
- **Recommendation**: Keep - functional monitoring page

## Import Analysis by File

### High-Priority Files to Review

1. **database-selector.tsx** (8.5KB)

   - Large component with comprehensive vector store selection logic
   - Used by rag-chat.tsx but RAG page redirects
   - May be unused if RAG functionality was migrated

2. **rag-chat.tsx** (14.8KB)

   - Extensive RAG chat implementation
   - Imports many components and hooks
   - Potentially orphaned due to RAG page redirect

3. **vector-store-monitoring.tsx** (12.3KB)
   - Complex monitoring dashboard
   - Active usage confirmed in monitoring page
   - All imports appear necessary for functionality

## Cleanup Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Verify RAG Integration**: Check if RAG functionality was moved to main chat
2. **Remove Redirect Page**: Delete `app/(chat)/rag/page.tsx` if not needed
3. **Audit RAG Components**: Remove `rag-chat.tsx` and `database-selector.tsx` if unused

### Verification Steps

1. Search codebase for direct imports of rag-chat and database-selector
2. Check if RAG functionality exists in main chat component
3. Verify monitoring page functionality still works

## Estimated Cleanup Impact

- **Files to potentially remove**: 3 (rag/page.tsx, rag-chat.tsx, database-selector.tsx)
- **Size reduction**: ~23KB of source code
- **Dependencies to audit**: Multiple imports in removed components

## Next Steps

1. Confirm RAG integration status with development team
2. Test monitoring page functionality
3. Execute cleanup of orphaned files
4. Update import statements in dependent files
