The disabled service now properly:\n1. Has `isEnabled: false` when no API key provided\n2. Returns correct error messages for disabled operations  \n3. Returns null for getFileSearchTool when disabled\n4. Returns empty arrays for read operations when disabled\n5. Returns proper health check status when disabled\n\nThe disabled service implementation in lines 290-353 was already correct - the issue was in the configuration logic that determines whether to use the disabled or enabled service.",

Citation Rendering Optimizations (components/citations.tsx)\n- Added React.useMemo for expensive display citation calculations\n- Implemented useCallback for event handlers to prevent re-renders\n- Early return optimization for empty citation lists\n- Improved component re-render performance\n\n### 3. Vector Store Service Optimizations (lib/vectorstore/unified.ts)\n- Added smart caching for search results with 5-minute TTL\n- Implemented Promise.allSettled for better error resilience\n- Optimized parallel search execution across multiple sources\n- Added cache-first strategy for repeated queries\n- Enhanced error handling with fallback mechanisms\n\n### 4. API Route Performance Improvements\n- Enhanced search API: Added request/response caching with 3-minute TTL\n- Chat API: Added rate limit caching to reduce database queries\n- Added response time headers (X-Cache, X-Response-Time)\n- Implemented proper cache hit/miss tracking\n\n### 5. Database Query Optimizations\n- Rate limit checks now cached for 5 minutes per user per day\n- Reduced repeated database queries for common operations\n- Added fallback mechanisms for cache failures\n\n### Performance Impact Estimations:\n- Citation parsing: 60-80% faster for repeated content\n- Citation rendering: 30-40% fewer re-renders\n- Vector store searches: 70-90% faster for cached queries\n- API response times: 50-80% improvement for cache hits\n- Database load: 60-70% reduction in rate limit queries\n\n### Monitoring & Metrics:\n- Added performance timing for all optimized operations\n- Cache hit/miss ratio tracking\n- Response time headers for debugging\n- Error resilience with graceful fallbacks",

Multi-Stage Architecture:\n- **Base stage**: Node alpine image (node:22-slim recommended)\n- **Dependencies stage**: Install production dependencies\n- **Build stage**: Execute Next.js build process\n- **Runtime stage**: Minimal production runtime only\n\n### 2. Next.js 15 Standalone Mode:\n- **Configuration**: `output: \"standalone\"` in next.config.mjs\n- **Benefits**: Includes only minimal files needed to run the app\n- **Docker optimization**: Purpose-built for containerization\n\n### 3. Production Security:\n- **Non-root execution**: Run application under restricted user\n- **Runtime environment variables**: Avoid embedding secrets in image\n- **Minimal base images**: Alpine-based for reduced attack surface\n\n### 4. Layer Optimization:\n- **Proper .dockerignore**: Exclude node_modules, tests, secrets\n- **Dependency caching**: Separate package installation from source code\n- **Build caching**: Optimize for subsequent faster builds",
