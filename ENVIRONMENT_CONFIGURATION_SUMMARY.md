- Environment-specific testing
- Automated rollback capabilities
- Security validation in CI pipeline

## üîÑ Migration Paths

### 1. Railway Native PostgreSQL
```bash
# Use Railway's managed PostgreSQL service
DATABASE_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}
RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID=${{RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID}}
RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID=${{RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID}}
```

### 2. External PostgreSQL on Railway
```bash
# Use external PostgreSQL with Railway hosting
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@external-host:5432/db
RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
```

### 3. Supabase Integration on Railway
```bash
# Use Supabase PostgreSQL with Railway deployment
POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://postgres:[PASSWORD]@[PROJECT_REF].supabase.co:5432/postgres
SUPABASE_URL=https://[PROJECT_REF].supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Configuration
